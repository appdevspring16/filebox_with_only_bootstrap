# Filebox with Only Bootstrap

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap.

## [Here is your target.](https://filebox-with-only-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository down to your computer.
1. In the GitHub app, **create a new branch for your work**.
1. Open the entire folder you downloaded in Atom.
1. Make your first change to `public/landing.html`.
1. Commit and Publish and verify that your branch shows up here on this page in the "Branch" dropdown box.
1. Open a Pull Request when you are ready to see how you are doing.
1. You can continue to Sync new commits right up until the due date.

## Suggested Steps

 1. I have already downloaded and included Bootstrap in the project for you.
 2. I have also included an `additional_styles.css` with some standard vertical spacer classes.
 3. There are `<link>`s to both in the `<head>` of your starting point, but they are commented out. Uncomment them to use them.
 1. Use [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) to create a skeleton grid for your layout, and then copy-paste it into your page.
 2. Plug in your content to each cell in your skeleton. You can copy-paste from the target, or from your previous Filebox project.
 3. You should be able to exactly match the target by only applying existing classes from either `bootstrap.css` or `additional_styles.css`; you need not write any CSS rules yourself.
